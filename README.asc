= Kinetic, a process runner


Runs commands and captures/monitors results. 

Commands can be linked together into workflows.

Because the commands are at the shell level, you can choose the technology you need for each
step in your workflow.

== Example Config flow

[toml]
----
[step-one]
schedule="0 1 * * *"
command="python -c 'print(\"step one\")'"
next="step-two"
error="error-one"

[step-one-error]
schedule="0 5 * * *"
command="python -c 'print(\"step one error\");raise Exception(\"2\")'"
next="step-two"
error="error-one"

[step-two]
command="echo step-two"

[error-one]
command="echo error-one"
----


// Allows authenticated remote execution of pre-defined jobs.

Kinetic runs at the user account level (e.g. files in user's home directory, permissions are user permissions)


[terminal]
----
$ kin log

job-id                                          status  start               end    pid     duration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sync-to-backup-NeP8nb4q                         OK      13:54  ->-          13:55  353842  1m 18s
ER: raise-exception-NePaHZyV                    ER      14:00  ->-          14:00  353983  2s
ER: print-output-NePaIKni                       ER      14:00  ->-          14:00  354000  2s
check-free-mem-NePb7aPc                         OK      14:01  ->-          14:01  354026  2s
----

(If the line begins with ER: there was error output, but the job may have returned/completed successfully - for this see the status column)

== Usage:

|====
| kin start | Install and start the kin server
| kin log |  List job runs
| kin edit | Edit job definitions
| kin list | List job definitions
| kin run <jobname> |   Run a job by its name
| kin help | See available commands 
| kin jl <job_id>  |   Fetch a job run's log
|====

== Configuration file:

Any .toml file in `~/.pm_dir` will be loaded. Example config.toml:

[toml]
----
[print-output]
schedule="0 13 * * *"
command="python -c 'print(\"hello\");raise Exception(\"2\")'"

[hello]
command="echo hello"
----

So to run the "hello" job from the command line, you can run `kin run hello`

=== Config properties

[toml]
----
[suitably-involved-command]                                  <-- jobname
command="cd $HOME/somewhere && getparams.sh | run_program"   <-- command to run
schedule="0 18 * * *"                                        <-- cron schedule to run at, optional
next="hello"                                                 <-- job to run next (comma delimited list ok)
error="print-output"                                         <-- (comma delimited list ook)
timeout=5000                                                 <-- max run length in seconds
----

== Miscellaneous info:
=== Statuses
----
OK
ER
GO 
CL
TI (Timed out)
SB (Job started before latest boot)
SK (Skipped/gavewayto)
----


=== Storage 
Config, logs and states are held in `$HOME/.kin_dir` (symlinks supported)


== Installation:
The kin executable file can be downloaded from the [red]#RELEASES# page and stored in your path (e.g. `$HOME/bin`)

then running `kin start`  will install and activate a user service

=== Building the executable yourself:

After cloning repo, `install.sh` will build the application and distribute it to your `$home/bin` directory.
