= Kinetic, a process runner


Runs processes on a schedule and captures/monitors results.

// Allows authenticated remote execution of pre-defined jobs.

This is intended to run per user account, and under user space (e.g. files in home directory, permissions are user permissions)

== Configuration file:

Any .toml file in `~/.pm_dir` will be loaded. Example config.toml:

----
[print-output]
schedule="0 13 * * *"

=== Storage 
Config, logs and states are held in `$HOME/.kin_dir` (symlinks supported)


== Installation:
The kin executable file can be downloaded from the [red]#RELEASES# page and stored in your path (e.g. `$HOME/bin`)

then running `kin start`  will install and activate a user service

=== Building the executable yourself:

After cloning repo, `install.sh` will build the application and distribute it to your `$home/bin` directory.
